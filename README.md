# bls_cuda
An implementation of Box-Least-Squares transit search using CUDA.

How does it work:

The idea is to send a few thousand jobs at a time to the GPU.  We loop through tossing blocks of frequencies to compute BLS for, and collecting the results as we go.  I've tested with Kepler data scanning over 700~000 frequencies from 0.5 days to the length of the dataset without issues.  You can't just assign one frequency per thread or you will quickly run out of VRAM.  

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jasonfrowe/bls_cuda.git`
2. Install required dependencies:  numba, numba-cuda, matplotlib (and others)
3. You can either have a look at the Jupyter Notebook (bls_cuda.ipynb) or try running transitfind5_gpu.py

## Commandline Usage
1. Make sure transitfind5_gpu.py is executable
2. `./transitfind5_gpu.py tlc29991541_5.d.dat`
3. The input file is a simple space delimited file with time and flux in two columns.
4. if everything works, then a plot should show up showing the results of your search
5. try: `./transitfind5_gpu.py` to see command usage

## CPU Version
1. You can use `transitfind5_cpu.py` if you want CPU based BLS.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project, go for it! There are a number of to-dos 
1. Code speed can likely be made much faster.  (shared memory vs global memory)
2. Better choices of blocks and threads-per-block needs to be explored
3. Making the code base into an installable package
4. Make CPU threading more efficient (spread around short-period jobs that take longer)
5. and much more..

## Change Log
2025/03/08 : Initial Update  
2025/03/08 : Added a 'V2'.  V2 works best with TESS CVZ lc, V1 works best with Kepler.  
2025/03/08 : Added CPU version (Numba + threading)
