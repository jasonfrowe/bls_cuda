# pytfit5

**An implementation of TransitFit5 and BLS in Python (with Numba).**

This package provides tools for transit search and fitting, including Box-Least-Squares (BLS) algorithms optimized for both CPU and GPU (via CUDA).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+

### Installing from Source
It is recommended to install this package in "editable" mode inside a virtual environment. This allows you to modify the source code without needing to reinstall.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jasonfrowe/bls_cuda.git
    cd bls_cuda
    ```

2.  **Install via pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Features

### Synthetic Lightcurve Generation
Generate realistic synthetic transit lightcurves with configurable stellar noise:

```python
import pytfit5.synthetic as syn

# Generate synthetic data with multi-component stellar noise
phot, sol = syn.generate_synthetic_lightcurve(
    time,
    period=10.0,              # Orbital period (days)
    t0=0.0,                   # Transit center time
    depth=0.01,               # Transit depth (1%)
    duration=0.1,             # Transit duration (days)
    white_noise=0.001,        # White noise amplitude
    stellar_noise_type='multi',  # Noise type: 'none', 'red', 'drw', 'multi'
    stellar_noise_amplitude=0.01,  # Stellar noise amplitude
    rotation_period=25.0      # Stellar rotation period (days)
)
```

**Stellar Noise Models:**
- `'none'`: White noise only
- `'red'`: Power-law (1/f^α) red noise
- `'drw'`: Damped random walk with exponential covariance
- `'multi'`: Multi-component model (granulation + activity + rotation)

**Returns:**
- `phot`: `phot_class` object with time, flux, ferr, itime, tflag, icut, flux_f arrays
- `sol`: Dictionary containing injected transit parameters

### Iterative Detrending
Automatically detect and protect transit signals during detrending:

The `run_polyfilter_iterative()` function iteratively identifies transit-like features (negative deviations) and excludes them from detrending, preventing signal suppression. This is especially useful when:
- Transit times are unknown
- Multiple transits of different depths exist
- Red noise is significant

**How it works:**
1. Apply initial polynomial detrending
2. Detect significant negative deviations (< -sigma_threshold)
3. Group consecutive outliers and filter by minimum duration
4. Mask detected features and re-detrend
5. Repeat until convergence or max_iters reached

## Usage

### Python Import (Recommended)
You can import the package and access the submodules (BLS, transitfit5, MCMC, etc.) directly.

```python
import pytfit5 as pytfit5

# Access submodules using the built-in aliases:
# pytfit5.gbls   -> bls_cpu
# pytfit5.tpy5   -> transitPy5
# pytfit5.kep    -> keplerian
# pytfit5.tmcmc  -> transitmcmc
```

### API Reference: Unified Configuration Class

The `tpy5_inputs_class()` is a **unified configuration class** that controls all parameters for photometry processing, detrending, and BLS transit search:

> **Note:** `gbls_inputs_class` has been deprecated and consolidated into `tpy5_inputs_class`. For backward compatibility, `gbls_inputs_class` is aliased to `tpy5_inputs_class`, but new code should use `tpy5_inputs_class` directly.

- `boxbin` (float, default: 2.0): Detrending window width in days
- `nfitp` (int, default: 2): Polynomial order for detrending (2 = quadratic)
- `gapsize` (float, default: 0.5): Gap detection threshold in days

#### Iterative Detrending Parameters (for `run_polyfilter_iterative`)
- `iter_max_iters` (int, default: 5): Maximum iterations for automatic transit detection
- `iter_sigma_threshold` (float, default: 3.0): Sigma threshold for detecting transit-like features
- `iter_min_duration` (float, default: 0.05): Minimum transit duration in days (~1 hour)

#### Outlier Clipping Parameters
- `dsigclip` (float, default: 3.0): Sigma threshold for derivative-based clipping
- `sigclip` (float, default: 3.0): Sigma threshold for simple clipping

#### Stellar Parameters
- `mstar` (float, default: 1.0): Stellar mass in solar masses
- `rstar` (float, default: 1.0): Stellar radius in solar radii
- `teff` (float, default: 5777): Effective temperature in Kelvin

- `lcdir` (str, default: ""): Lightcurve directory path
- `zerotime` (float, default: 0.0): Time offset for epochs
- `freq1` (float, default: -1): Minimum search frequency in cycles/day (auto if -1)

**Example Usage:**
```python
import pytfit5.transitPy5 as tpy5

# Read photometry
phot = tpy5.readphot("lightcurve.dat")

# Configure unified parameters (detrending + BLS)
tpy5_inputs = tpy5.tpy5_inputs_class()

# Detrending settings
tpy5_inputs.boxbin = 3.0  # 3-day detrending window
tpy5_inputs.nfitp = 2     # Quadratic polynomial

# BLS settings
tpy5_inputs.zerotime = 0.0
tpy5_inputs.mstar = 1.0
tpy5_inputs.rstar = 1.0
tpy5_inputs.freq1 = 0.1  # Search down to 10-day periods
tpy5_inputs.normalize = "iterative_baseline"

# Standard detrending
tpy5.run_polyfilter(phot, tpy5_inputs)

# OR use iterative detrending to auto-detect and protect transits
tpy5_inputs.iter_max_iters = 5       # Maximum 5 iterations
tpy5_inputs.iter_sigma_threshold = 3.0  # 3-sigma detection
tpy5_inputs.iter_min_duration = 0.05    # 1-hour minimum duration
tpy5.run_polyfilter_iterative(phot, tpy5_inputs)

# Run BLS with the same unified config
import pytfit5.bls_cpu as gbls
gbls_ans = gbls.bls(tpy5_inputs, phot.time, phot.flux_f)
```

### Lightcurve Visualization

The `plot_lightcurve_summary()` function provides comprehensive visualization of photometry data:

```python
import pytfit5.transitplot as transitp
import pytfit5.bls_cpu as gbls

# Basic plot: raw and detrended flux only
fig = transitp.plot_lightcurve_summary(phot, tpy5_inputs=tpy5_inputs)

# Enhanced plot: includes BLS results with phased lightcurve and transit closeup
gbls_ans = gbls.bls(tpy5_inputs, phot.time, phot.flux_f)
fig = transitp.plot_lightcurve_summary(phot, bls_ans=gbls_ans, tpy5_inputs=tpy5_inputs)
```

**Features:**
- **2-panel mode** (no BLS): Shows raw flux and detrended flux in vertical stack
- **4-panel mode** (with BLS): Adds phased lightcurve and transit closeup with statistics
- Automatically marks transit locations in time series
- Transit closeup shows ±1 duration window around transit center
- Statistics panel displays period, T0, SNR, duration, and depth
